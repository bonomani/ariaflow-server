# Backend Gaps Requested by Frontend

> **Ownership:** Authored and maintained by the **ariaflow-web** frontend agent.
> The backend agent should read this file at session start, fix open items,
> and move them to the Resolved section when done — but should NOT add or
> delete entries (that's the frontend's responsibility).
>
> **Single source of truth — no mirrors.**
>
> **Pairing rule:** Every open backend gap should have a paired frontend gap in
> `../ariaflow-web/FRONTEND_GAPS.md` marked `Blocked by: BG-N` (unless it's
> pure infrastructure with no user-visible counterpart — then `Blocks frontend gap: (none)`).

### BG-12: Remove unused `/api/sessions/new` endpoint — RESOLVED

> Resolved 2026-04-09. Endpoint, handler (`post_session`), OpenAPI spec,
> discovery entry, and all endpoint-specific tests removed. The helper
> `start_new_state_session()` in `state.py` was preserved (has other callers).
> Cross-check tests updated to call it directly. Commit `34f039a`.

### BG-11: Residual under-specified fields after BG-10 fix — RESOLVED

> Resolved 2026-04-08. Backend shipped 8 of 14 fields (commits e7e98a7,
> b0efcb8, 26c25e2). The remaining 6 were verified by the frontend agent
> as fields the frontend never reads — schemas were updated on the
> frontend side instead. See "Frontend resolution" section below.

The BG-10 backend pass added 7+ component schemas and resolved most
endpoints, but the frontend cross-check
(`../ariaflow-web/tests/test_openapi_alignment.py`) still surfaces 14
field-level gaps across 5 endpoints. These are likely small leftovers
the BG-10 sweep missed.

**Affected endpoints and missing field names:**

| Endpoint | Missing in openapi.yaml |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/status` | `created_at`, `enabled`, `output`, `percent`, `pid`, `reachable` |
| `GET /api/declaration` | `policy`, `ucc` (top-level buckets) |
| `GET /api/sessions` | `ended_at` |
| `GET /api/peers` | `ip` |
| `GET /api/downloads/archive` | `created_at`, `ended_at`, `next_cursor`, `output` |

**Notes per endpoint:**
- `/api/status`: item entries lack `created_at` and `output`; the
  `Aria2Health` shape lacks `enabled` and `reachable`; `EngineState`
  lacks `pid`; the `active`/`actives` shape lacks `percent`. The
  frontend reference is
  `../ariaflow-web/docs/schemas/api-status.schema.json`.
- `/api/declaration`: the top-level `policy` and `ucc` buckets are
  declared in the frontend schema but not in openapi.yaml — they
  should at least be `type: object` with a description, even if
  passthrough.
- `/api/sessions`: each session entry has `started_at` but not
  `ended_at`; add it as `nullable: true`.
- `/api/peers`: peer entries lack `ip` (likely typo or oversight —
  `port` and `infohash` were added).
- `/api/downloads/archive` was not part of the original BG-10 but
  surfaces the same problem: `items[]` is bare `type: object`.

**Desired:** Add the missing fields (or the missing component schemas)
so the frontend cross-check reports **0 warnings**.

**How to verify:**
```
cd ../ariaflow-web && python3 -m pytest tests/test_openapi_alignment.py -q
```
Expected: 16 passing, 0 warnings.

**Impact on ariaflow-web:** Same as BG-10 — no runtime breakage; the
cross-check warnings prevent the frontend from tightening
`tests/test_openapi_alignment.py` to a hard assertion.

**Blocks frontend gap:** (none — pure infrastructure)

**Priority:** low

#### Backend status (2026-04-08, commits 26c25e2 + b0efcb8 + e7e98a7)

**Shipped — 8 of 14 fields are now in openapi.yaml:**

| Field(s) | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `/api/status items[].created_at`, `output` | Added to QueueItem component (also gained `priority`) — `/api/downloads/archive items[]` now `$ref`s the same component, so its `created_at` and `output` are covered too |
| `/api/status pid`, `reachable` (ariaflow side) | New `AriaflowHealth` component with `reachable`, `version`, `schema_version`, `pid`. `/api/status ariaflow` now `$ref`s it. |
| `/api/status reachable` (aria2 side) | New `Aria2Health` component with `reachable`, `version`, `error`. `/api/status aria2` now `$ref`s it. |
| `/api/status percent` | New `ActiveTransfer` component with `gid/url/status/error_*/download_speed/completed_length/total_length/files/percent/recovered`. `/api/status active` now `$ref`s it. |

Two new TIC tests pin these against the live builders so future drift surfaces immediately:
- `TestOpenapiSchemas.test_bg11_status_subobjects_pin_real_field_names`
- `TestOpenapiSchemas.test_bg11_queue_item_component_has_created_at_and_output`

**Not shipped — 6 fields don't exist in backend code today:**

| Field | Reality | Suggested resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/status enabled` | Not present in any builder. `aria2_status()` only returns `reachable/version/error`. | Frontend may want a derived flag combining `reachable` + something else — needs design conversation. |
| `/api/declaration policy`, `ucc` | `DEFAULT_DECLARATION` only has `meta`, `uic`, `targets`. No `policy`/`ucc` top-level buckets. | Either add empty buckets to `contracts.py` (deliberate design decision) or update the frontend schema to expect what's actually returned. |
| `/api/sessions items[].ended_at` | `_log_session_history` writes `closed_at`. | Either rename `closed_at`→`ended_at` in `state.py:266` (breaks any other consumer) or update the frontend schema to use `closed_at`. |
| `/api/peers items[].ip` | `_resolve_dns_sd` writes `host` (the hostname). DNS-SD doesn't expose IPs at the browse layer. | Update the frontend schema to use `host`, or add an explicit DNS resolution step in `discovery.py`. |
| `/api/downloads/archive next_cursor` | The endpoint uses limit-based slicing (`items[-limit:]`), not cursor pagination. | Implement real pagination — that's a feature, not a doc fix. |
| `/api/downloads/archive ended_at` | Archive items are queue items (no `ended_at`); `completed_at` exists on `QueueItem`. | Same rename question as `/api/sessions`. |

These six need a frontend conversation — they're not unilateral backend changes. BG-11 is left **open** in this file because the frontend may want to file a follow-up (BG-12) for the renames/features, or update its JSON schemas to match the actual field names. Once that decision is made, BG-11 can be moved to Resolved.

#### Frontend resolution (2026-04-08)

The frontend agent verified each contested field against `app.js` and
`index.html` and decided **no backend code change is needed**. The
frontend already consumes the fields the backend actually publishes;
the ariaflow-web schemas were declaring fields the frontend never reads.

| Field | Frontend usage | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/status aria2.enabled` | not referenced anywhere in `app.js`/`index.html` | Dropped from `docs/schemas/api-status.schema.json`. The remaining required field for `aria2` is just `reachable`. |
| `/api/declaration policy`, `ucc` | top-level buckets never read by frontend | Dropped from `docs/schemas/api-declaration.schema.json`. Only `uic.preferences[]` is consumed. |
| `/api/sessions items[].ended_at` | frontend reads `session_closed_at` (and `session_started_at`, `items_total`, `items_done`, `items_error`) — see `index.html:696` | Schema updated: `started_at`→`session_started_at`, `ended_at`→`session_closed_at`, `total/done/error`→`items_*`. Backend's existing names are kept. |
| `/api/peers items[].ip` | frontend reads BOTH `item.host` and `item.ip` (`app.js:519,539`), but the canonical field from `_resolve_dns_sd` is `host` | Schema updated: `ip`→`host`. |
| `/api/downloads/archive ended_at` | not referenced; archive items only show `id`, `url`, `output`, `status` (`index.html:824-835`) | Dropped from schema. |
| `/api/downloads/archive next_cursor` | frontend uses limit-based pagination via `archiveLimit` (`app.js:230,1189`) | Dropped from schema. |

**Verification:**
```
cd ../ariaflow-web && python3 -m pytest tests/test_openapi_alignment.py -q
# 16 passed, 0 warnings
```

The frontend's `tests/test_openapi_alignment.py` was tightened from
warn-mode to a hard assertion in the same change. Future schema/spec
drift will fail the test, not warn.

**No backend action required.** BG-11 is **RESOLVED** as of 2026-04-08.

---

_No other open gaps._

## Explicit non-requests (do not implement)

Decisions made to prevent re-proposal by future agents. None of these will
ever be filed as BG entries.

| Topic | Decision | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Per-interface RX/TX byte counters | **Do not add** | Ariaflow is a download manager, not a network monitor. Users have `htop`/`btop`/Activity Monitor for network stats. The existing per-download speed + aggregate sparkline + bandwidth probe already answer "how much is flowing" for this domain. |
| Interface enumeration via API | **Do not add** | Exposes network topology. The frontend already enumerates its own interfaces via `local_identity()` in `bonjour.py`. Remote clients don't need to see the backend's interfaces; they already have one working URL. |

---

Historical resolved entries are preserved in git history.

## Resolved

*(BG-1 through BG-12 cleaned — see git log for history)*

BG-10 was resolved across two backend commits:
- Generator extension + 3 endpoint schemas (declaration / lifecycle / log) + UccEnvelope component
- Remaining 6 endpoint schemas (bandwidth / bandwidth-probe / sessions / sessions/stats / torrents / peers)
Five new TIC tests pin each schema against the live response so future drift surfaces immediately. Run `tests/test_openapi_alignment.py` from ariaflow-web to confirm 0 warnings.
