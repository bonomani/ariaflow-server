## Open items

### [P3] BG-11: Aspirational fields the frontend wants that don't exist in backend code

**What:** BG-11 listed 14 missing fields. The 8 fields that actually exist in code are now declared in openapi.yaml and pinned by TIC tests. The remaining 6 are **aspirational** — the frontend wants them but the backend code doesn't return them. They are feature requests, not documentation drift.

**Real fields shipped (not in this item — already done):**
- `/api/status items[].created_at`, `output`, `priority` — added to QueueItem component
- `/api/status ariaflow.{reachable,version,schema_version,pid}` — new AriaflowHealth component
- `/api/status aria2.{reachable,version,error}` — new Aria2Health component
- `/api/status active.{gid,url,status,percent,…}` — new ActiveTransfer component
- `/api/downloads/archive items[]` — now `$ref`s QueueItem

**Aspirational fields requiring backend code changes (this plan item):**
- `/api/declaration: policy`, `ucc` (top-level buckets) — `DEFAULT_DECLARATION` only has `meta`, `uic`, `targets`. Adding empty buckets is a 2-line `contracts.py` change but it should be a deliberate design decision, not a doc fix.
- `/api/sessions items[].ended_at` — `_log_session_history` writes `closed_at`. Either rename `closed_at`→`ended_at` or have the frontend rename its expectation.
- `/api/peers items[].ip` — `_resolve_dns_sd` writes `host`. Same rename question.
- `/api/status enabled` — does not appear anywhere in `src/aria_queue/`. Probably from `aria2_status()`; the frontend may want a derived `enabled` flag combining `reachable` + something else. Needs frontend conversation.
- `/api/downloads/archive: ended_at`, `next_cursor` — the archive endpoint uses limit-based slicing, not cursor pagination. Adding `next_cursor` is a real feature.

**Where:** Each fix touches a different file (`contracts.py`, `state.py`, `discovery.py`, `routes/downloads.py`). They are unrelated changes that should not be bundled.

**Decision needed:** For each of the 6 fields, decide one of:
- **Rename in backend** to match the frontend's expectation (cheap, breaking for any other consumer)
- **Rename frontend expectation** in `../ariaflow-web/docs/schemas/*.json` (frontend agent's responsibility)
- **Implement the feature** (e.g. real cursor pagination)
- **Decline** with a note in `BACKEND_GAPS_REQUESTED_BY_FRONTEND.md`'s explicit non-requests table

This is not a single commit — it's 6 small decisions. Frontend agent should weigh in.

### [P3] Pre-existing lint and format debt blocking a strict `make ci`

**What:** `make lint` reports **27 ruff errors** (mostly unused imports — e.g. `tests/test_unit.py:723` imports `allowed_actions` "just to verify import works"). `ruff format --check` reports **35 files** that would be reformatted. Both predate this session.

**Why:** A `make ci` target that runs `verify + lint + format --check` was proposed but skipped because both pre-existing failures would make it red on first invocation. Once cleared, `make ci` becomes a 1-line addition.

**Where:**
- `make lint` output enumerates the 27 errors. Most are `F401` unused imports — `ruff check --fix src/ tests/` will auto-resolve 24 of them. The remaining 3 need hand inspection.
- `ruff format src/ tests/` (without `--check`) will rewrite the 35 files in place. Verify the resulting diff doesn't introduce semantic changes (it shouldn't — ruff format is whitespace/style only).

**Scope:**
- Lint pass: ~5 min for the auto-fixable 24, plus inspection for the 3 holdouts.
- Format pass: 1 command, 35-file diff. Single commit.
- `make ci` addition: 4 lines.

**Decision needed before starting:** confirm the bulk format diff is acceptable as a single commit (35 files touched, whitespace-only). If yes, do format → lint → add `make ci` as three commits in sequence.

---

Deferred (informational only):
- `check_declaration_drift.py` reports 23 prefs missing from the *user's local* `~/.config/aria-queue/declaration.json`. Not a repo issue — per-machine state. The existing `|| true` in the Makefile is correct.

## How to use this file

This is the **single plan file** for the project. Do not create separate plan files.

### Rules

0. **Task 0: clean git before starting.** Before executing any plan item, verify `git status` is clean (no uncommitted changes, no untracked files except `.claude/`). Show the output as evidence. If not clean, commit or stash first. Never start work on a dirty tree.
1. **One plan file.** All planned work goes here. No `BUGFIX_PLAN.md`, `REFACTOR_PLAN.md`, etc.
2. **Done → remove.** When an item is completed, delete it from this file. Git history has the record.
3. **Declined → keep briefly.** If an item was evaluated and rejected, keep a one-liner with the reason. This prevents re-proposing the same idea.
4. **Empty → keep the file.** Even with no open items, keep this file with the instructions.
5. **Prioritize.** Items are ordered by priority. Top = do first.
6. **Be concrete.** Each item has: what to change, where in the code, why, and estimated scope.
7. **Checkpoint after each item.** Run tests, commit, update docs.
8. **No stale plans.** If a plan item has been open for more than 2 sessions without progress, re-evaluate it — either do it or decline it.

### Execution workflow

Before starting:
```
□ git status                    # must be clean
□ git pull --rebase origin main # start from latest
□ python -m pytest tests/ -x -q # all tests pass
```

For each plan item:
```
□ read the plan item
□ read the code to change
□ implement the change (smallest diff possible)
□ python -m pytest tests/ -x -q # all tests pass
□ update docs if affected
□ git add <specific files>      # no git add -A
□ git commit                    # descriptive message
□ remove the item from PLAN.md
□ git add docs/PLAN.md
□ git commit "Update plan"
□ git push origin main          # if rejected: pull --rebase, re-test, push
```

After all items done:
```
□ python -m pytest tests/ -x -q # final pass
□ python scripts/gen_rpc_docs.py # regenerate if code changed
□ python scripts/gen_all_variables.py --check # naming compliance
□ verify PLAN.md says "No open items"
□ git push origin main
□ rm -rf .claude/worktrees/     # clean temp working folders
□ git status                    # confirm clean tree
```

### What NOT to do

- Don't start coding without checking `git status` first
- Don't batch multiple plan items into one commit
- Don't use `git add -A` (risk of committing secrets or generated files)
- Don't skip tests between items
- Don't leave uncommitted changes when stopping work
- Don't create plan files other than this one
- Don't `git checkout` or `git reset --hard` without understanding what will be lost (uncommitted work is gone forever)
- Don't modify code you haven't read first

### Item template

```
### [Priority] Short title

**What:** Description of the change
**Where:** File(s) and function(s) affected
**Why:** Problem it solves or value it adds
**Scope:** Estimated lines changed / files touched
**Depends on:** Other items that must be done first (if any)
```

## Declined

_Items evaluated and rejected. Kept to prevent re-proposing._

- **Remove `stopped` status** — `stopped` (system decided) vs `cancelled` (user decided) is a useful distinction. Merging them loses information.
- **Per-torrent Bonjour advertisement** — Replaced by API-based discovery (`GET /api/torrents`). Single `_ariaflow._tcp` service is simpler and Apple-compliant.
- **Scheduler start/stop API** — Scheduler now auto-starts with `ariaflow serve`. Users can only pause/resume. Simpler state model.
